# Guess the Number Game

ðŸš€ Throwback to the Classics: Guess the Number Game! ðŸš€

## Introduction

Feeling nostalgic? This retro "Guess the Number" game is a fun way to revisit classic programming concepts while enjoying a simple yet addictive game. This project was inspired while I was revising my JavaScript skills, and I decided to build this game for fun.

## How to Play

    The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 20.

    Your task is to guess the number.

    You'll get feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.

    Try to guess correctly before your score drops to zero!

## Features

    Keeps track of your current score and high score.
    
    Fun, retro-style design with a classic gaming font.

    Instant feedback to keep you on your toes.
